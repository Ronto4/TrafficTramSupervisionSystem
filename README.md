# Traffic Tram Supervision System

This is a C# interface for the Traffic Tram Supervision System (TTSS).
TTSS is known to be used by the public transit operators in Krak√≥w (PL) and Potsdam (DE).
It allows operators to provide real-time information about their vehicles and trips to customers.

This project is created in a similar fashion as the equivalent Python project at <https://github.com/tomekzaw/ttss>.

## Usage

### Installation

The TTSS Client is available via Nuget at <https://www.nuget.org/packages/TtssClient>.

### API routes

This client supports most but not all TTSS routes.
Have a look at [`./TtssClient/TtssApi.cs`](./TtssClient/TtssApi.cs) for supported routes.

# Traffic Tram Supervision System

This is a C# interface for the Traffic Tram Supervision System (TTSS).
TTSS is known to be used by the public transit operators in Krak√≥w (PL) and Potsdam (DE).
It allows operators to provide real-time information about their vehicles and trips to customers.

This project is created in a similar fashion as the equivalent Python project at <https://github.com/tomekzaw/ttss>.
